- title: Introduction

        - Stop shipment.
        - Change cash on deivery.


- title: Authentication
  content: |
    The Modify delivery API requires authentication for all its endpoints. See the [getting started guide on authentication](/api/#authentication) if you're not sure what this means.

    | Header | Example | Comment |
    |:-------|:--------|:--------|
    | `X-MyBring-API-Uid` | `john.doe@example.com` | Mybring login ID |
    | `X-MyBring-API-Key` | `1234abc-abcd-1234-5678-abcd1234abcd ` | Mybring login's API key |
    | `X-Bring-Client-URL` | `https://example.com/ ` | A URL that sort of identifies where you're using the APIs. |

    Those headers must be present for authenticating requests.
