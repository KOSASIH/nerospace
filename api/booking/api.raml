documentation:
- title: Introduction
  content: |

      The Bring Booking API is a logged-in service that lets Mybring users (customers of Mybring) programatically create a booking by invoking a Web Service over SOAP or by posting XML/JSON over HTTP. The API uses the same backend as [Mybring Booking](https://www.mybring.com/booking/) and the same PDF labels.

      We support two types of integration with the Booking API. XML/JSON over HTTP and SOAP (over HTTP).

      Booking uses Shipping Guide as the source for price and availability for the different services. We advise clients of the Booking API to use [Shipping Guide API](/api/shipping-guide_2/) for getting the list price and checking availability before sending a booking request. Note that invoice payment is the only available payment option for the Booking API. This means that the Mybring user ID used in the booking request must have access to the customer number specified as payer of the booking.

      This API has similarities with the Shipment API, but there are differences. Read more about the [differences between the Booking API and the Shipment API](/api/booking-shipment/).

- title: Versioning strategy
  content: |
      Each request has a `schemaVersion` element indicating which release of the schema is being used in the request and expected schema format in the response. Important: All clients must accept new (unknown) elements in the response. E.g. unknown elements should be ignored. The client framework used by client must thus not crash when unknown elements are encountered. Note that this requirement excludes the (old, but still widely used) Apache Axis 1.x Web Service client framework.

- title: Encoding
  content: |
    Booking endpoints will assume all requests are UTF-8 encoded

- title: Authentication
  content: |
    The Booking API requires authentication for all its endpoints. See the [getting started guide on authentication](/api/#authentication) if you're not sure what this means.

- title: Authorization
  content: |
    In addition to authentication, you need to be authorized with the _booking_ right in order to perform bookings. This is done in [customer administration in Mybring](https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/external/administration):

    ![Authorized for booking](booking_authorization.png)

    To perform a booking, you must specify which customer number to use. For your convenience, there is an [API for getting the customer numbers](#list-customer-numbers) associated with your API user. The Customer Number API also links customer numbers with the services the customer number is valid for.

- title: Making labels
  content: |
    The Booking API generates and sends all necessary EDI messages to carry out the shipment. A URL to a PDF label is returned in responses. This label must be printed and be attached to the shipment. A URL that points to tracking information is also returned.

    A GET request to the label URL will result in a HTTP 302 redirect to the concrete storage facility (e.g. redirect to Amazon S3). Ensure that your client follows these redirects.

- title: Performance
  content: |
    Different service groups have different response times in booking:

    - Parcels and courier services
      - A booking will typically take < 2 seconds
    - Express UPS services and Cargo
      - A booking will typically take < 3 seconds
    - Express Nordic SameDay
      - A booking will typically take < 10 seconds (query in flight schedules). We are working on improving the response times for QuickPack SameDay, making popular city-pairs much faster.

- title: QR Codes
  content: |

    It is now possible to request QR codes for certain products. An end user can bring the QR code to a PiB or a Post Office, scan the QR code, and have a label printed there.

    To book, add the element `generateQrCodes` at the consignment level and set it to `true`. The response will contain one `qrCodeLink` per package. This is a URL to a PNG image of the QR code.
    
    The following services support QR codes:
    - 9300
    - SERVICEPAKKE_RETURSERVICE
    - 9600
    - EKSPRESS09_RETURSERVICE
    - 9000
    - BPAKKE_DOR-DOR_RETURSERVICE

    Currently, the following post offices support QR code label printing:
    Høyden, Tromsø, Asker, Stavanger, Sandnes, Bodø, Harstad. Elisenberg, Ski, Bergen sentrum, Molde, St. Olav plass, Stjørdal, Trondheim sentrum, Rodeløkka, Vika, Nydalen, Majorstua

    The following selected PiBs support the same as a self service option:
    Giæverbukta Tromsø, Extra Råholt, Plantasjen Tunejordet, Coop Obs Lagunen, Coop Obs Bryne, Extra Hillevåg, Extra Iseveien Borgenhaugen, Extra Tromsdalen, Bunnpris Heimdal, Meny Stoa, Extra Støver, Rema 1000 Metro Lørenskog, Obs City Nord Stormyra, Coop Obs Jessheim, Coop Prix Frankendalsveien Nanset, Coop Mega Berja, Kiwi Svolvær sentrum, Rema 1000 Olsrød Park Tolvsrød, Østerås Post i Butikk, Sandvika storsenter postpunkt, Volla Post i Butikk
    
    Eventually, all PiBs and post offices will support label printing based on QR code.
    
- title: Mailbox Parcel (Pakke i Postkassen)
  content: |

    #### About Mailbox parcel
    
    - Booking Mailbox Parcel in Booking API is a single-step process with one label per booking (multi-kolli is not supported). Each parcel is invoiced separately. A link to the label is returned in the response. 
    - When booking Mailbox Parcel in Booking API, the new API customer number is used. This is identical to your company's main customer number (without prefix PARCELS_NORWAY and without padded zeros if any).
    - When booking Mailbox Parcel in Booking API, the service is defined by setting 3584 or 3570 in the product id. 

    To book, order one of the two product ids:
    
    ### 3570 (tracking with RFID)
    Mailbox Parcel shipments can optionally be ordered with tracking using RFID.

    #### How does tracking with RFID work?
    Normally, we create PDF labels that can be printed on any printer.

    If you opt for tracking, we create ZPL labels instead. ZPL stands for [Zebra Programming Language (ZPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_(programming_language)).

    The labels will be ZPL code containing instructions for programming the passive RFID antenna in the printer's labels with package numbers.

    In addition to the RFID programming instructions, the ZPL code contains instructions for rendering the rest of the label (addresses, icons, barcode, etc.).

    ##### Special hardware required
    RFID-tagged labels require special printer hardware. Currently we support the following printers:

    - Zebra R410
    - Zebra 500R

    ### 3584 (no tracking)
    If you don't have a supported printer, you cannot order shipments with tracking. In this case, we will create normal PDF labels that can be printed using any printer.

    ### Additional Service : Bag on door (Pose på døren)
    A delivery alternative for Mailbox Parcels that cannot be delivered to the mailbox. 

    Mailbox Parcel (Pakke i postkassen) is a parcel that will be delivered in the recipient’s mailbox. If the parcel for various reasons does not fit in the mailbox, the sender may, against a surcharge of NOK 15 per shipment, choose to leave the parcel on the door handle (in a special bag) to avoid it being sent to the pickup point (surcharge of NOK 23 per shipment). This delivery option will have to be confirmed by the receiver upon booking in the sender's webshop. When the parcel is delivered as a bag on the door, the bar code is scanned and the recipient will receive an SMS/email. Note that if the parcel is delivered in the mailbox the additional fee will not occur.

    #### Terms of delivery
            
    The sender must clearly inform the recipient about the criteria of Bag on door when displaying this service in the check out (e.g. via Shipping Guide API):
      
    - The distance from the mailbox to the recipient's door must not exceed 250 m 
    - House no. must be clearly marked
    - The door must be clearly marked with the recipient's name 
    - Posten must have access to the recipient's door, even when the main entrance is locked, for instance when recipient live in an apartment. 
      
    Knowing these critera, the recipient must actively accept Bag on door as a delivery option.
      
    In cases where the criterias are not met, i.e. bad weather (risk of damage) or where for security reason the risk is considered too high to use Bag on door, the parcel will still be delivered to the recipient's pickup point for delivery.

    ### Example request
    There is an example request for 3584 in "More examples" section below. Booking 3570 is just a matter of changing the service code from 3584 to 3570. If you want to specify a different return address on the label than your actual sender address, use the returnTo party tag. When the returnTo party tag is populated the input will replace your actual sender address on the top left corner of the label.

- title: Customs information
  content: |
    It is required to pass customs information when booking the following services from Norway -> abroad:

    - Business Parcel
    - PickUp Parcel

    When included during booking, the customs information will be sent electronically from Bring to the destination country.

    If sending customs information, the following elements are to be used:

    - quantity (required)
    - goodsDescription (required)
    - customsArticleNumber (optional)
    - itemNetWeightInKg (required)
    - tarriffLineAmount (required)
    - currency (required)
    - countryOfOrigin (optional)
    - natureOfTransaction (required)

    Please refer to the _Request params_ section below for more details about the elements. Customs tariff codes (tolltariffnummer) can be found [here](http://tolltariffen.toll.no/).

    #### Example

    In this example, you are sending a parcel/shipment with 2 shampoos, 5 cotton t-shirts and 1 wool jacket. The number of pieces is 8 (2 shampoos + 5 cotton
    t-shirts + 1 wool jacket), and the number of articles is 3 (shampoo, cotton t-shirt, wool jacket). The whole shipment is referred to as an item.

    | Quantity | Description of contents | Customs tariff code | Total content net weight (kg) | Total content value | Currency | Country of origin |
    |:--------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
    | `2` | `shampoo` | `33.05.1000` | `3.0` | `200` | `NOK` | `CH`|
    | `5` | `cotton t-shirts` | `61.09.1000` | `2.5` | `1000`| `NOK`| `PL` |
    | `1` | `wool jacket` | `61.04.3100` | `2.0` | `750` | `NOK`| `DE` |

    <strong>Nature of Transaction</strong>: Gift or Sale of Goods or Returned Goods or Commercial Sample or Documents or Other

    Sending `Importer` party in the request is not mandatory. But if there is no importer sent then system will consider recipient as importer.

    Another additional field captured for customs is `vatNumber` for the parties. This is an optional field. If you are setting importer party then you can add `vatNumber` in it,
    else you can set `vatNumber` in the existing recipient party.

    There are two examples in the _More Examples_ section below that show requests containing customs information.
    * In one of these examples, importer not sent in request, hence the recipient is the importing party with (optional) `vatNumber`.
    * In the other example, there is importer party set in the request with the (optional) `vatNumber`.

      See the "More examples" section below to see examples on how to use value added services.

      <strong>We have added a new tag and by that a new way of requesting value added services. Both ways are still supported, but they can not be combined.</strong>

      * All the new value added services will be added supporting only the new way.

      * The old way will be decommissioned after some time.

      Where you before had to send each additional service as a tag under the services tag, the new way has a list of additionalService tags under the additionalServices tag, where the id element identify the additonal service to request.

       <strong>XML</strong>

      ```
       <additionalServices>

      ```

      #### Error handling

      If an error occurs, the following will be provided:

      - `uniqueId`: A unique log ID (UUID) that can be used as a reference for the error
      - `code`: An error code describing the error
      - `message`: Internationalized messages (with <message lang="”xx”"> elements). First version will be with lang=”en” (English) only. </message>

      See the [error codes](#error-codes) below to get an overview of error codes and what they mean.

      #### Testing

      This service will send actual production orders unless it is set to testing mode.

      To use the test mode, you need to set the `testIndicator` flag to `true` on the root node.

      Note that the examples below use `testIndicator=true`, so remove this when implementing the Booking API in your production system.

      #### Measurements

      For cargo services(5100, 5300, CARGO, 9100), Weight is mandatory and one of the Volume / Load Meter / Dimensions / Number of Pallets is mandatory

          #### Attempted delivery

          If a sender want their package delivered to the door, and it cannot be delivered (i.e. Business closed or recipient is not present), then you can now choose what will happen with your package.

          If you want Bring to try deliver only once and/or deliver package to nearest PiB, then you must tell us by setting this option. These options cost extra money but the customer/sender will only be charged if the event happen.

          Example:

          You send a package to a business with the `deliveryOption=TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_PIB`.

          - If Bring manage to deliver the package to the recipient on first try, then no extra charges is made.
          - If first attempt to deliver fails, then Bring will do a second attempt. The customer/sender will be charged extra.
          - If the second attempt also fails, then the package will be delivered to nearest PiB. The customer/sender will be charged extra.

          Possible options:

          - `ONE_DELIVERY_THEN_PIB`
          - `TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_PIB`
          - `TWO_DELIVERIES_THEN_RETURN`

    The Pickup Order API is for ordering a single pickup at a particular address.

    Parcels Norway, Parcels Sweden, Parcels Denmark and Cargo customers with a Mybring user ID can use this service. Customer numbers in this API are the same as to the Booking API, obtained either through your Mybring profile or the customer number API.

    <strong>We have added new tags for new way of requesting pickup. Both ways are still supported, but they can not be combined.</strong>

    * All the new pickup services will be added supporting only the new way.

    * The old way will be decommissioned after some time.

    Where  before you had to send different tags under the `pickupOrderRequest` tag for ordering different types of pickup .
    Now the new way introduced two tags  `service` and `pickupDetails` under `pickupOrderRequest` tag , one to capture type of service you wanted to book and one to capture what will be picked up.

    Example: Ordering pickup for parcel shipments in Norway

    The new way of requesting pickup

    ```
     <service>PARCEL</service>
     <pickupDetails>
             <numberOfPackages>1</numberOfPackages>
             <numberOfPostContainers>1</numberOfPostContainers>
             <numberOfPallets>1</numberOfPallets>
     </pickupDetails>
    ```
    <strike>The old way of requesting pickup </strike>

    ```
     <parcelsInformation>

            <numberOfPostContainers>1</numberOfPostContainers>
            <numberOfPallets>1</numberOfPallets>
     </parcelsInformation>
    ```


    Pickup in the different countries requires different customer numbers:


    | Customer number prefix | Pickup in country | Required information element     |

    If your company has been converted to services with new service names (revised services) in Booking and Shipping Guide, pickup of parcels and/or cargo in Norway is done using your company's new API customer number - i.e your company’s main customer number. You company's main customer number equals your PARCELS_NORWAY-*********** customer number, without prefix PARCELS_NORWAY- and any leading zeros.

    #### Pickup is ordered by default with service CARGO_GROUPAGE from Bring Cargo

    A pickup order is necessary to get the goods collected for transportation by Bring Cargo but you don't have to worry about it when ordering with the API .

    A pickup will be automatically ordered together with the shipment when ordering a `CARGO_GROUPAGE` shipment.

    If you order many shipments the pickups will be aggregated by Bring Cargo to one pickup by place and date.
