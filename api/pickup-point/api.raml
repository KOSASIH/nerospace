          <strong>The Pickup Point API becomes authenticated from 01.11.2020</strong>
            <br><br>
              Our customers are increasingly demanding new functionality and solutions that are easy to use. To meet these expectations, we must know which customers and partners are using our APIs and how they are using them.

              To further develop the value proposition of our Pickup Point API, the solution becomes authenticated from 01.11.2020.

              We recommend making the <a href="/api/pickup-point/#steps-for-authentication">adjustment</a> already now, well in advance of summer vacations and peak season.

      The Pickup point API provides a list of locations for package pickup. Based on a specified postal code or a geographical location, the 10 nearest pickup points are returned, sorted by driving time by car(source: Google). In instances where google is unable to retrieve driving times from a location to a pickup point(e.g. location on mainland and pickup point on an island), these pickup points will be sorted by aerial distance and placed last in the list. Response is available as either XML or JSON.

      A pickup point is defined as any location delivering shipments on behalf of Bring and Posten, such as post offices, selected grocery stores, lockers, etc.

      It is important to note, there are two sets of addresses in the response, postbox(address, postalCode) and visiting address(visitingAddress,visitingPostalCode).Postbox address is required to get a package produced correctly, use this AS RECIPIENT address on label. Visiting address is more appropriate for user interface (Street address of the PIB).
      
      ### Filtering results

      In addition to postal code or location, one or more optional parameters can be added to the request, adding additional restrictions to the pickup points being returned. One such parameter is `searchForText=<texts>`, resulting in a response where all pickup points have at least a partial match with the search string given in `<texts>`. This can be the name of the pickup point, its address, city, county, municipality or location. Go to the reference table or see additional examples for more information.

      ### Rate limiting

      The Pickup point API has a rate limit, primarily considered on a per-user basis. Currently it limits API users to no more than 60 requests within a minute from a single IP address.

      Once you go over the rate limit, you will receive a response with an HTTP response code of 429 (Too Many Requests). The body of the response will consist of the following fields:

      - `code`: `429`
      - `error_message`: `The maximum number of requests per minute has been exceeded.`

      As an additional note, While accessing the Pickup point API together with Shipping Guide API, the service list should be displayed even in the case that the request has been rate limited by the Pickup point API.

      #### High-volume users

      If you're a high-volume user of the Pickup Point API, please [contact us](mailto:developer@bring.com) to discuss your options.

      When contacting Bring support include a description of how you are using the Pickup Point API, also an estimate of current request volumes.

      Before you can begin using the pickuppoint API you'll have to do the following:
         * [Sign up for a Mybring account](https://www.mybring.com/signup/register/user) if you do not already have one. If you're already registered in Mybring, head to the [settings and API](https://www.mybring.com/useradmin/account/settings/api) page to get your API key.
         * [Generate an API key](/api/#authentication) for your user

      ### 1. Get your API key from Mybring
      To make API requests you will need an API key. Click the link below, which sends you to your "Settings and API" page in Mybring profile administration. Scroll down to the "API key" section. Your generated API key which you will use to authenticate your requests can be found here.

      ### 2. Add authentication headers
      A description of the headers can be found in [Getting Started / Authentication](/api/#authentication).

        description: |
          Sometimes (especially in Denmark) it's a good idea to also specify the address when searching for pickup points, to get more accurate results.

          In [this example](https://api.bring.com/pickuppoint/api/pickuppoint/DK/postalCode/2000.json?street=Smallegade&streetNumber=3), we look for pickup points in Smallegade 3, 2000 Frederiksberg.

          application/json:
            example: !include examples/filter_address.json

        displayName: Find pickup points containing a specific string

          If you want to return only the pickup points matching a specific string, you may use the `searchForText` query param. The given text can be the name of the pickup point, its address, city, county, municipality or location. Partial matches are also allowed.

          In [this example](https://api.bring.com/pickuppoint/api/pickuppoint/NO/postalCode/1407.json?searchForText=KIWI), we look for pickup points near NO/1407 cotaining "Kiwi".

        displayName: Find pickup points open on specific days
        description: |
          If you want to return only the pickup points open on specified days, you may use the `openingHoursSearchType=<day>` query param. `<day>` be:

          - `ALL_WEEKDAYS` (default)
          - `MONDAY`
          - `TUESDAY`
          - `WEDNESDAY`
          - `THURSDAY`
          - `FRIDAY`
          - `SATURDAY`
          - `SUNDAY`

          If you want you can also add `openOnOrBefore` and / or `openOnOrAfter`, to limit the search even more.

          In [this example](https://api.bring.com/pickuppoint/api/pickuppoint/NO/postalCode/1407.json?openingHoursSearchType=SUNDAY), we look for pickup points near NO/1407 that are open Sundays.
        body:

        displayName: Find pickup points open at specific hours
        description: |
          If you want to return only the pickup points open on specific hours, you may use the `openOnOrBefore=<time>` and/or `openOnOrAfter=<time>` query params.

          The format of `<time>` is `HHmm`.

          In [this example](https://api.bring.com/pickuppoint/api/pickuppoint/NO/postalCode/1407.json?openOnOrBefore=0800), we look for pickup points near NO/1407 open on or before 08:00.
